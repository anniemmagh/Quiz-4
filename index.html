         <p>Understanding Cryptocurrencies</p>
         <p>Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.</p>

         <h1 style="color: white;"> <b>ABOUT US</b></h1>
         <p>United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and bank, founded in 2011.[3][4] The exchange provides trading between cryptocurrency and fiat currencies, and provides price information to Bloomberg Terminal.[5] As of December 2021, Kraken is available to residents of 48 US states and 176 countries, and lists 95 cryptocurrencies available for trade,</p>
        <p>n 2011, founder Jesse Powell visited the offices of cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox following that company's 2011 security breach.[7] Powell told Bloomberg News he began working on Kraken as a replacement for Mt. Gox if that company were to permanently close, which it did in 2014.[8]

            In September 2013, Kraken launched after two years of testing and development. The exchange initially offered bitcoin, litecoin, and euro trades. It later added additional currencies and margin trading.[9]
            
            In July 2013, Kraken joined other US Bitcoin players in the emerging payments and digital-currency industry to form the Committee for the Establishment of the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA). The stated aim of the committee was to establish DATA as the future self-regulatory body of the industry.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] DATA held its first annual meeting in April 2014.[17][18][19]
            
            In October 2013, Kraken announced that it had discovered major flaws in the Namecoin protocol and would not list the cryptocurrency until they were removed. Former Kraken COO Michael Gronager, during the security analysis for onboarding the new cryptocurrencies, spotted a major vulnerability in the domain registration system and a bug that left .bit domain names susceptible to attacks and reassignment. Although the flaws were soon fixed and Namecoin was listed on the Kraken exchange, it was de-listed two years later after a decline in its trading volumes.[20]</p>
